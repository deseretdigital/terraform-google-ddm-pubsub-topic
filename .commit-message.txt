feat!: upgrade to Google Provider v7.0 with enhanced features

BREAKING CHANGE: Updated Google provider requirement from 6.5.0 to ~> 7.0. Users must upgrade to Google provider v7.x to use this version.

- Updated Google provider version constraint to ~> 7.0 in both root and topic-schema modules
- Added Terraform required_version >= 1.3 constraint for better compatibility

New Features:
- Added kms_key_name variable for Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) support
- Added message_storage_policy variable for regional data residency constraints
- Added project variable for explicit project specification
- Added effective_labels output to track all labels including GCP-managed ones
- Added kms_key_name output for encryption key visibility
- Added schema_settings output in topic-schema module

Improvements:
- Implemented dynamic blocks for message_storage_policy (null-safe implementation)
- Enhanced README documentation with comprehensive examples
- Added examples for encryption, regional constraints, and schema validation
- Updated all provider version references from v6.0 to v7.0
- Removed empty data.tf files for cleaner codebase

This upgrade enables enhanced security features and better resource management
while maintaining backward compatibility for all configuration options except
the provider version requirement.
